This is a web app for paediatric anaesthetists, borne out of my own need for the automation of drug calculations and consolidation of guidelines in one place. The aim of the app is to minimise human error, by not relying on mental arithmetic (I was a sleep deprived first-time mum returning to work after maternity leave), and to make guidelines easily accessible while on the go.

This was a challenge for me because I was learning on my own, and it was often difficult to know what best practice was. Most of my learning had been through YouTube, so I decided to do Colt Steele's Bootcamp on Udemy for a bit more structure.

Some of the things that I learned through building this:
- vanilla JS: working with objects, arrays, loops and iteration
- Responsive web design (it was really important for this to be good on mobile devices to be used on the go)
- How to customise colours in Bootstrap
- Routing in Express JS
- DOM manipulation
- rendering PDFs in iframes
- using tables in HTML
- working with partials

On a personal level this project is close to my heart because it's really what sparked my interest in coding. I realised the potential for benefit on a larger scale when my department adopted the app. It was also really fun to build. üí´
